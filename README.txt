This is a 3d printer filament database for your personal 3d printer filaments. It offers a pricing calculator and automatic spool weight and number of spools tracker.

Place the exe or py file into its own folder and run it. The database will be automatically generated upon first launch. From there you can build your own personal database of filaments for use in your 3D printing adventures.

This is a very much in developement project and will be updated over time to make it more usable/cleaner. 

The goal of this project was to learn python in the realm of data analytics and engineering. I have approximately 3 weeks of python experience at time of writing. 

This project is still not up to my personal quality standards but it has come a long way in the week I have spent on it. I took one python course a number of weeks back. After that I spent one day on this project. I got a few lines of code but ended up shelving the project for about three weeks. I came back and within a few days had written a mostly usable program that did most of what I wanted it to do. From there I spent a few more days cleaning it up and making it less janky. 

the original program was entirely within a single while loop. I converted each function into an actual coded in function, made another function to take out reduntant and repetitive lines of code, and fixed up a few odds and ends. 

I have a lot more planned for this project. Stay tuned.
